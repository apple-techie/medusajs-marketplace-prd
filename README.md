### Using Git Worktrees for Parallel Development

Git worktrees allow multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without branch conflicts.

#### Setting Up Worktrees

1. **Clone the main repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/medusajs-marketplace.git
cd medusajs-marketplace
```

2. **Create worktrees for each major feature:**

```bash
# Core Platform
git worktree add ../marketplace-core -b feature/core-architecture

# Vendor Management
git worktree add ../marketplace-vendors -b feature/vendor-management

# Order Management
git worktree add ../marketplace-orders -b feature/order-management

# Customer Experience
git worktree add ../marketplace-customer -b feature/customer-experience

# Operations Hub
git worktree add ../marketplace-operations -b feature/operations-hub

# UI/UX Implementation
git worktree add ../marketplace-ui -b feature/ui-components

# Commerce Features
git worktree add ../marketplace-commerce -b feature/commerce

# Delivery Network
git worktree add ../marketplace-delivery -b feature/delivery-network
```

3. **Navigate to specific worktree:**
```bash
cd ../marketplace-vendors
# Work on vendor management features
```

4. **List all worktrees:**
```bash
git worktree list
```

### Development Workflow

#### Phase 1: Core Setup (Weeks 1-2)
Reference: `01-CORE-ARCHITECTURE/`

```bash
cd ../marketplace-core
# Implement based on 01-PLATFORM-OVERVIEW.md
# Set up MedusaJS project structure
# Configure database schemas from 03-DATABASE-SCHEMA.md
```

#### Phase 2: Vendor System (Weeks 3-4)
Reference: `02-VENDOR-MANAGEMENT/`

```bash
cd ../marketplace-vendors
# Implement vendor types from 01-VENDOR-TYPES.md
# Build commission structure from 02-COMMISSION-STRUCTURE.md
# Create onboarding flow from 03-VENDOR-ONBOARDING.md
# Develop dashboards from 04-VENDOR-DASHBOARDS.md
```

#### Phase 3: Order Management (Weeks 5-6)
Reference: `03-ORDER-MANAGEMENT/`

```bash
cd ../marketplace-orders
# Implement order flow from 01-ORDER-FLOW.md
# Build routing system from 02-FULFILLMENT-ROUTING.md
# Create operations dashboard from 03-OPERATIONS-DASHBOARD.md
```

#### Phase 4: Customer Features (Weeks 7-8)
Reference: `04-CUSTOMER-EXPERIENCE/`

```bash
cd ../marketplace-customer
# Implement age verification from 01-AGE-VERIFICATION.md
# Build customer dashboard from 02-CUSTOMER-DASHBOARD.md
```

#### Phase 5: Operations Hub (Weeks 9-10)
Reference: `05-OPERATIONS-HUB/`

```bash
cd ../marketplace-operations
# Build comprehensive operations dashboard
# Implement real-time monitoring
# Create fulfillment management system
```

#### Phase 6: UI Implementation (Weeks 11-12)
Reference: `06-UI-UX/`

```bash
cd ../marketplace-ui
# Implement design system from 01-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md
# Build components from 02-COMPONENT-SPECIFICATIONS.md
```

### Merging Worktrees

After completing work in a worktree:

```bash
# In the worktree directory
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement vendor management system"
git push origin feature/vendor-management

# Create pull request and merge to main
# After merge, remove worktree
cd ../medusajs-marketplace
git worktree remove ../marketplace-vendors
```

## Migration Notes

This PRD has been restructured from the original files:
- All legacy files have been migrated to organized sections
- Content has been preserved and enhanced with better organization
- The structure now supports parallel development using git worktrees
- See `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` for details about the restructuring process
