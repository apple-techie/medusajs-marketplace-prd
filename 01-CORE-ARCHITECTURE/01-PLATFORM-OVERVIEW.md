# Platform Overview - MedusaJS Marketplace

## Executive Summary

Transform the existing marketplace platform into a MedusaJS-powered affiliate marketplace with a unique commission-based business model. This platform creates a multi-stakeholder ecosystem where shops earn commissions without holding inventory, brands reach customers through affiliates, and distributors handle fulfillment.

## Business Model

### 1. Shop (Affiliate) Commission Structure

Shops act as affiliates, earning commissions on sales they generate without holding inventory.

| **Silver** | 20% | $15,000 - $50,000 | Increased commission |
| **Gold** | 25% | $50,000+ | Maximum commission |

**New Shop Incentive**: All new shops receive Gold tier benefits (25% commission) for their first 3 months, regardless of sales volume.

### 2. Brand Platform Fees

Brands pay platform fees based on their monthly sales volume.

| Tier | Platform Fee | Monthly Volume | Description |

| **Enterprise** | 20% | $500,000+ | Premium tier with additional services |

### 3. Distributor Platform Fees

Distributors handle warehousing and fulfillment, paying fees based on volume and market position.
