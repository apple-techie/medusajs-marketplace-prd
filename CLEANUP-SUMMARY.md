# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: July 22, 2025  
**Type**: Documentation cleanup to remove outdated/conflicting files

## Overview

Cleaned up documentation that could cause confusion or provide contradictory guidance given the new hybrid implementation strategy.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created DEPRECATED.md
- Lists superseded approaches and documentation
- Provides clear hierarchy of current documentation
- Guides developers to the correct resources

### 2. Deleted MARKETPLACE_INTEGRATION.md
- Completely removed the outdated file
- No archive kept to prevent any confusion
- File was providing incorrect implementation guidance
- Could mislead developers into wrong approach

### 3. Updated Storefront Implementation
- Added note directing to IMPLEMENTATION-STRATEGY.md
- Clarified relationship between documents

## Why These Changes Were Necessary

### The Problem
The `MARKETPLACE_INTEGRATION.md` file provided a basic marketplace module approach that:
- Only handled simple vendor models
- Didn't account for 3 vendor types (Shop, Brand, Distributor)
- Lacked commission tier structure
- Missing multi-application architecture
- No shared component strategy
- No integration with Mercur patterns

This could lead developers to:
- Implement an overly simplistic marketplace
- Miss critical business requirements
- Build incompatible with the hybrid strategy

### The Solution
By archiving outdated docs and creating clear deprecation notices:
- Developers are directed to current strategy
- Historical context is preserved
- No confusion about which approach to follow
- Clear migration path for existing work

## Documentation Hierarchy (Current)

1. **Primary Reference**: `IMPLEMENTATION-STRATEGY.md`
2. **Architecture Details**: `01-CORE-ARCHITECTURE/04-FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. **Application Specific**:
   - Storefront: `04-CUSTOMER-EXPERIENCE/03-STOREFRONT-IMPLEMENTATION.md`
   - Components: `06-UI-UX/03-COMPONENT-ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Files Status

### ✅ Cleaned/Updated
- `/medusajs-marketplace/MARKETPLACE_INTEGRATION.md` → **DELETED** (was codebase poison!)
- `/medusajs-marketplace-prd/DEPRECATED.md` → Created
- `/medusajs-marketplace-prd/04-CUSTOMER-EXPERIENCE/03-STOREFRONT-IMPLEMENTATION.md` → Updated

### ℹ️ Potentially Outdated (Not Modified)
Generic READMEs in `/medusajs-marketplace/src/*/README.md` remain but are clearly placeholder files that don't provide conflicting guidance.

## Impact

This cleanup ensures:
- Clear direction for new developers
- No conflicting implementation approaches
- Preserved historical context
- Reduced confusion and rework
- Aligned documentation with hybrid strategy

## Next Steps

1. Update any remaining module READMEs as they're implemented
2. Add cross-references in key documents
3. Consider adding a "Getting Started" guide that points to the hybrid strategy
4. Regular documentation audits as implementation progresses
