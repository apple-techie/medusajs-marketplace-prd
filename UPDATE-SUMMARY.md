### 2. Technology Stack
- **Base**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **UI**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **State**: Zustand
- **Data**: TanStack Query
- **Real-time**: Socket.io

### 3. Implementation Phases
1. Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-2)
2. Core Marketplace Features (Weeks 3-4)
3. Unique Features (Weeks 5-6)
4. Vendor Portals (Weeks 7-8)

## Benefits of Hybrid Approach

### Development Efficiency
- 3-4 months saved vs. building from scratch
- Proven e-commerce functionality from Next.js Starter
- Marketplace patterns from Mercur
- Reusable components across all apps

### Technical Advantages
- Consistent design system
- Shared business logic
- Type safety across applications
- Optimized build process

### Business Benefits
- Faster time to market
- Lower development risk
- Easier maintenance
- Clear upgrade path

## Next Steps

1. **Set up monorepo structure** with Turborepo
2. **Install Next.js Starter** for storefront
3. **Analyze Mercur** for reusable patterns
4. **Create shared packages** for UI and logic
5. **Begin customization** of storefront

## Migration Path

For teams already working on the project:
1. Review new architecture documents
2. Align current work with monorepo structure
3. Extract shared components to packages
4. Implement new patterns incrementally

This hybrid approach provides the optimal balance between leveraging existing solutions and building custom features for the unique marketplace requirements.
